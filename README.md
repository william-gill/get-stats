# get-stats
An example python script for pulling app analytics from Amplitude and doing some basic analysis.

This script is designed to work with Amplitude as a data source. It is not tested with any other analytics source.
If you use a different analytics tool, you will need to refer to the documentation and update the URL construction as well as the DataFrame structure.

This script is intented to serve as an example for how Growth Product Managers can use Python to automate many data analysis and reporting tasks.

This script is also written for maximum readability and simplicity. It does some non-conventional things, like using global variables. 

Feel free to use this script, copy it, modify it, etc.
